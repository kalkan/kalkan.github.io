I am currently actively working as a Remote Sensing Group Leader at [TUBITAK Space Technologies Research Institute](https://uzay.tubitak.gov.tr/). My main area of research is image processing of earth observation satellites. On this website, you can find information about my previous and current work and materials related to my current courses.

In the past, while working as a Research Assistant at [ITU Geomatics Engineering Department](https://geomatik.itu.edu.tr/), I had the opportunity to work on very important projects in the laboratory we called UZAL with my esteemed advisors [Derya Maktav](https://avesis.itu.edu.tr/maktavd/deneyim) and [Filiz Sunar](https://avesis.itu.edu.tr/fsunar). After that, I worked at Havelsan in the Image and Signal Processing Group for 4 years in various Hyperspectral Image Processing projects. I have been working at TÜBİTAK Space for about 8 years.

I completed my undergraduate, graduate and doctoral studies at Istanbul Technical University Geomatics Engineering Department. You can access my CV from the relevant link.
